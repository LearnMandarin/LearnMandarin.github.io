      <h3 class="head">Mandarin: All you need to know</h3>
      <p class="p">Mandarin Chinese is the official language of Mainland China and Taiwan. While it is the most spoken dialect,
      there are also other dialects which the second most spoken dialect is Cantonese. Despite there being different
      dialects, they all share the same Chinese characters. There are two types of Chinese characters,
      simplified and traditional. Traditional Chinese tend to be more complex than simplified
      because traditional Chinese characters were adapted to be easier to write and distinguish, hence
      the name simplified Chinese. While most places in China now use simplified Chinese and speak Mandarin,
      it is important to understand that places such as Hong Kong may still use traditional Chinese Mandarin
      and most people in Hong Kong speak Cantonese.</p>
      <h3 class="head">History</h3>
      <p class="p">Mandarin had first started being spoken widely towards the end of the Ming Dynasty
      (1368-1644) and was the language of the ruling class. Towards the end of the Ming Dynasty,
      the capital of China changed from Nanjing to Beijing. Due to the fact that Mandarin was
      based upon the Beijing dialect, Mandarin was adopted as the official language of the court.
      However, it was not until 1909 that Mandarin became the national language of China.<br><br>
      Mandarin uses Chinese characters which date back to more than 2000 years and early forms of
      the characters were based on real objects but had become more advanced and styled throughout
      the history of China.</p>
